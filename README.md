# twitter_sentiment-analysis
For to know the sentimental prediction of any statement ,first we need to make the data clear enough to use it efficiently.
remove all stopwords, punctuations, and anyother special charachter.
In some of the cases '#' can play an imp role in doing the predictions but in my case they are not that much important so i removed them also,
then inbuilt MultinomialNB model is used to classify the sentiments.
